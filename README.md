# Process Centric Service 1 (main)

This is the first centric service for MyHealthyLife application. As for the centric 2 this service has to integrate all the data coming from the 4 primitive services. It performs requests for retrieving persons (and editing their data), the suggested foods, the goals for a user, the available measure types. The service also offers the possibility to register new users and get suggested sentences based on the measures of a particular user. These are all functions that provide a 'personal' interface for the end user, in the sense that the handled content regards always the single user. It runs as a RESTful service and as so it uses GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods following the REST directives.
